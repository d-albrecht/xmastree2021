small (companion) file to my submitted animation file(s)
-----

The sources to my animations can be found [here](https://github.com/d-albrecht/XMas-Tree-Explosions).

The names reflect my internal book-keeping. A more matching name would have been "fireworks", but (a) I hadn't thought about that alternative when naming the repo and now choosing a different name for the resulting file would be bad for "corporate identity" reasons and (b) I feel like "firewoks" last year was kind of a bad omen for animations with this name. I also kept the "working title" to prevent one file overwriting another in case I decide to submit others down the line.

My animations are intended to be viewed at 30fps. Several discussions on this repo and the linked one from Harvard suggest that this might be the actual hardware capability. If not, then several of the available simulators have proven to me that even with another frame-rate the animation is still enjoyable.

I wish you all a Happy New Year!
